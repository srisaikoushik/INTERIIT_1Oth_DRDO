# INTERIIT_1Oth_DRDO

 The information and files that were submitted for the 10th INTERIIT DRDO problem statement are available in this repository.
 
 Run the final codes after completing the installation of px4, gazebo, and ROS on your system so that each file can carry out its function simultaneously 
 and enable autonomous UAV navigation by spotting roads in the surrounding region. The other task is to use a downward-facing camera to detect the UGV and 
 control it so that it doesn't move away from the road.
